Here are any necessary lines to be entered into the terminal:

python manage.py runserver          <- replaced by json file

This is also a test file to check if files are being properly pushed to the repo
Test 2

Open "http://127.0.0.1:8000/hello/VSCode" instead of "http://127.0.0.1:8000/"

In practice, run "python manage.py collectstatic" any time you change static files and before deploying into production.
This copies 'hello/site.css' into 'static_collected' folder
