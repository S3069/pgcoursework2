Here are any necessary lines to be entered into the terminal:

python manage.py runserver          <- replaced by json file

This is also a test file to check if files are being properly pushed to the repo
Test 2

Open "http://127.0.0.1:8000/hello/VSCode" instead of "http://127.0.0.1:8000/"

In practice, run "python manage.py collectstatic" any time you change static files and before deploying into production.
This copies 'hello/site.css' into 'static_collected' folder

When working with models...
(1) Make changes to the models in your 'models.py' file.
(2) Run "python manage.py makemigrations" to generate scripts in the migrations folder that migrate the database from its current state to the new state.
(3) Run "python manage.py migrate" to apply the scripts to the actual database.
